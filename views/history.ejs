	<h2>History</h2>

	<p>
		The Snitch was created by our founder Dale Bell in October 2019. Dale recruited many early Snitch members who remained throughout; Bill Angell, a skilled writer; Caleb Levy and Benjy Eichner, two talented editors; and Auguste Rame, the programmer behind The Snitch's website.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Snitch went through a "dry phase" in late 2019 and early 2020, but then COVID-19 hit, which allowed us to flex our web muscles and go on a recruiting binge, leading to The Snitch and Snitch team we know today.
